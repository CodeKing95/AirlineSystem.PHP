# ✈️ Airline Management System

The Airline Manangement System is a full-stack web application which is developed to manage airline operations such as flight management, bookings, and passenger's data. This kind of project I have previously developed as part of my web development assignment during my university Bsc studies. So I have decided why not rebuilt it again from scratch to improve the architecture, performance, and overall code quality. 

# 🚀 Features
- Passenger and booking management.
- Full CRUD functionality of Passengers.
- Secure data handling between frontend and backend.
- Managing airline and flight data.
- Responsive and user friendley Interface.

# Technologies 
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- BOOTSTRAP
- Backend:
- Server-side framework (PHP).
- Database:
- MySQL.

# 🎯 Purpose of the Project
The main purpose of this project was to:
- Demonstrate a full-stack web application skills.
- Improving the implementation with much better design and structure.
- Gaining hands-on experiece with real-world airline management workflows.
- Lastly, to get comfortable with the full-stack application.

# 📚 What I Learned
- Developing and building a full-stack applications.
- Backend database schema design.
